# Namaste Node.js – Episode 1

## Chapter 01: Introduction to Node.js

This repository contains a beginner-friendly summary of **Namaste Node.js – Episode 1**.  
It explains what Node.js is, why it was created, and how it evolved over time.

---

## What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment built on **Chrome’s V8 engine**.  
It allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, enabling developers to build servers, APIs, and other backend applications using JavaScript.

---

## Key Features of Node.js

### 1. Runtime Environment
- Executes JavaScript outside the browser
- Powered by Chrome’s **V8 engine**

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Uses events to handle multiple operations efficiently
- Does not wait for one task to finish before starting another

### 3. Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O
- File system and network operations are non-blocking
- Improves performance and scalability compared to synchronous servers

---

## Development History of Node.js

### Creation and Early Development
- Created by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009
- Initially experimented with **SpiderMonkey**
- Later switched to **Google V8** for better performance
- Originally named **web.js**, later renamed to **Node.js**

### Support from Joyent
- **Joyent** supported Node.js in its early development stages

---

## Node.js vs Traditional Servers

Before Node.js:
- Servers like **Apache** followed a blocking I/O model
- Limited concurrent request handling

With Node.js:
- Uses **non-blocking I/O**
- Handles multiple requests efficiently with fewer resources

---

## Evolution of NPM (Node Package Manager)

- **NPM** is the package manager for Node.js
- Developed by Joyent in **2010**
- Initially available for macOS and Linux
- Added Windows support in **2011** with Microsoft’s help

## Leadership and Community Changes

### Leadership Transition
- **2012**: Ryan Dahl stepped down
- **Isaac Z. Schlueter** (creator of NPM) took over

### io.js Fork and Reunification
- **2014**: Node.js forked into **io.js**
- **2015**: Node.js and io.js merged back together

### OpenJS Foundation
- **2019**: JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged
- Formed the **OpenJS Foundation** for long-term, community-driven development

---

## Present and Future of Node.js

- One of the most popular JavaScript runtimes
- Strong open-source community
- Huge ecosystem powered by **NPM**
- Widely used for scalable and high-performance applications

---

## Who This Is For

- Beginners learning Node.js
- Frontend developers moving to backend
- Learners following the **Namaste Node.js** series
